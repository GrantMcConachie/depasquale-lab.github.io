# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Group

If you are interested in conducting research within the group as a PhD student, please apply to the BU [BME PhD program](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/explore-degree-programs/phd-in-biomedical-engineering/) or the BU [graduate program in neuroscience](  https://www.bu.edu/neuro/academics/graduate/). Unfortunately, I cannot respond to individual email inquiries about joining my group as a PhD student. If you are interested, apply to one of the programs above. 

For prospective PhD students, my rotation project policy is to encourage you to bring your **own ideas** to the table. I rarely 'assign' projects!

If you are interested in a postdoc, please [email Brian](mailto:bddepasq@bu.edu).
