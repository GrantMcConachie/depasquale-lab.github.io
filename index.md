# Artificial and Biological Intelligence Laboratory at Boston University

The DePasquale lab is located in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/biomedical-engineering/) at Boston University. We develop mathematical models to understand how populations of neurons perform computations to produce behavior. Broadly we take two approaches. One is data-driven: we collaborate with experimental neuroscientists to develop tailored machine learning models of neural activity to identify the algorithms that drive behaviors such as decision-making or movement. Our second approach is theoretical: we construct and analyze artificial neural network models to understand how their structure gives rise to analogous computations and other functional features observed in biological neural circuits.
