I conduct research in theoretical neuroscience and machine learning. My research uses mathematical models to characterize and explain how populations of neurons perform computations to produce behavior. As of Janurary 2023, I am an [assistant professor](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/brian-depasquale-ph-d/) in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University where I run the Artificial and Biological Intelligence Laboratory.

I conducted my postdoctoral research with [Carlos Brody](http://brodylab.org/) and [Jonathan Pillow](http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/jpillow/) on latent variable models of evidence accumulation. During my Ph.D. I worked with [Larry Abbott](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/neurotheory/Larry/) developing methods for training recurrent neural networks, and with Mark Churchland connecting these models conceptually to statistical models of low-dimensional dynamics applied to data. Before that I studied the basal ganglia in the laboratory of Ann Graybiel.

## Science Writing

In addition to doing science, I sometimes write about other peopleâ€™s science. Below are some examples I have contributed to the Simon's Collaboration on the Global Brain.
