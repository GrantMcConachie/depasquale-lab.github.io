Assistant Professor, Biomedical Engineering
Boston University
(617) 353-2816
**Office: 413, 44 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA, 02215**

I conduct research in theoretical neuroscience and machine learning. My research uses mathematical models to characterize and explain how populations of neurons perform computations to produce behavior. 

As of Janurary 2023, I am an [assistant professor](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/brian-depasquale-ph-d/) in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University where I run the Artificial and Biological Intelligence Laboratory.

I conducted my postdoctoral research with [Carlos Brody](http://brodylab.org/) and [Jonathan Pillow](http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/jpillow/) at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/) on latent variable models of evidence accumulation from 2016 to 2022. During my Ph.D. (2009-2016) I worked with [Larry Abbott](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/neurotheory/Larry/) at [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University developing methods for training recurrent neural networks, and with Mark Churchland connecting these models conceptually to statistical models of low-dimensional dynamics applied to data. Before that I studied the basal ganglia in the laboratory of Ann Graybiel at MIT.
